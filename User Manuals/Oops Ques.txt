1) What is OOP? Explain its principles and benefits.
 OOP is a programming paradigm that focuses on creating objects that interact with each other to solve problems. 
 inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

Benefits of oops?
code reusability, modularity, and maintainability.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
2)What is a class in Java? What is an object?
 A class in Java is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties and behavior of the objects that will be created from it. An object is an instance of a class that has its own state and behavior.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
3) Inheritance:
Inheritance in Java is the ability of a subclass to inherit properties and behavior from its superclass.
The subclass can add its own unique properties and behavior as well.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
4) Polymorphism:
   Polymorphism in Java is the ability of an object to take on many forms. It allows a subclass to have its own implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. 
Example: Draw--Shape--circle
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
5) Encapsulation:
  Encapsulation in Java is the process of hiding the implementation details of an object and only exposing the necessary methods and properties.
Example:Bank-- exposes only depositing and withdrawing money.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
6)Abstraction:
  Abstraction in Java is the process of creating a simplified representation of a complex object or system. It allows you to focus on the important details and ignore the irrelevant ones.
Example:car--expose only the starting ,stopping et and hides the internal workings.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
7) Access Modifiers:
 Access modifiers in Java control the visibility and accessibility of a class, method, or variable. There are four access modifiers in Java: public, private, protected, and default.
