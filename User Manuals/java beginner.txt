floating point with integer always the result will in floating point.

5 + 5 * 6
=35

PRECEDENCE --- * / % > + -

to do first + 
do (5 + 5) * 6

Statement- Instruction given to computer

String literal-"Something between Double Quotes"

printf() method allows formatting and printing values from expressions

%d- for integer
%s- for string
%f- for floating

A variable is comething whose vale can change over the lifetime of the program.
In the program at different statges , these variables have different values.

Java is strongly-typed language.

Variables in Depth

Variable & Memory
Naming a varaible and rules
Variable Types-
Assignment operator

How variables are stored in memory?
  int a=10;
  int b=80;
variables will store in random memory ocation.
  
Naming a variable:

Combination of letters,numbers,$ and under_score(_).
Cannot start with a number
cannot be a keyword
no limit on length of identifier
CamelCase

Primitive variable datatypes:
byte-8bits , short-16bits , int-32bit , long-64bits

float f=4.5f --32 bits
double d=4.8 --64 bits

char c='A'

boolean isPrime=true
               =false

Assignment operator(=):

Copying the value of expression on the right-hand side to the varaible on the left-hand side


for loop

for i=1 to 10
statement;

for(initialisation;condition;update)
statement;

comparison operator(==)--To compare with variable

In if statement only one statement should fall under the if

If we want a group of statements under a condition we use block {}

(n%2==0)

METHODS

A name we give it to set of lines of code is a method
Meyhods can have inputs
methods can have outputs

Method Syntax

ReturnType nameOfTheMethod() {
    //Body of the method
}
