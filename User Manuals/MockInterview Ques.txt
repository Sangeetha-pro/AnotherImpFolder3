1)Difference between java and java 8 features?

1.Lambdas-
   --allow developers to define functions inline, without the need for a separate method declaration. 

2.functional programming
  --programming paradigm that emphasizes the use of functions as the primary building blocks of software.
  functions are treated as first-class citizens, which means they can be passed as arguments to other functions, 
  returned as values, and stored in variables.

3.Streams-
   --which provides a way to process collections of data in a functional and declarative style. Streams enable parallel processing 
   and lazy evaluation, which can lead to better performance and more efficient use of system resources.

4.Date and time API-
   --provides a more robust and flexible way to handle date and time data in Java applications.


5.Optional class-
  --which provides a way to handle null values in a more concise and functional style.
  Optional enables developers to write more expressive and readable code handles null values in a more robust and error-resistant way.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2)Life cycle of JPA Hibernate

   --Java persistent API is a specification for object-relational mapping in Java

   --Hibernate is a popular implementation of the JPA specification

   --The JPA Hibernate life cycle is managed by the EntityManager API, which provides methods for persisting, updating, and removing entities. 

LifeCycle:

Entity creation-->Transient state-->Managed state-->Detatched state-->Removed state-->re-attached state

1. Entity Creation- The JPA Hibernate life cycle begins when a new entity object is created. This entity must be annotated with the @Entity annotation to be recognized as a JPA entity.

2. Transient state (non-permenent state)- The entity is in the transient state(non-permenent state) when it is not associated with a persistent(consistent/continuous)context.
                          --This means that any changes made to the entity will not be persisted to the database.

3. Managed state: The entity enters the managed state, when it is associated with persistent context. typically in entity manager api
                This means any changes made to the entity it will be tracked and persisted to the database, when the transaction is commited.

4. Detached state- The entity enters the detached state,when it is not associated with persistent context.
                 This will happen when EntityManager is closed or transcation is rolledback.
                 In this state , that any changes made to the entity will not be persisted to the database.

5. Removed State- The entity enters the removed state when it is explicitly removed from the database using the EntityManager API.
                In the removed state, the entity is marked for deletion from the database when the transaction is committed.

6. Re-attached state-An entity can be re-attached to a persistent context by calling the EntityManager API.
                 In the re-attached state, any changes made to the entity will be tracked and persisted to the database when the transaction is committed.

database operations into single transaction.To ensure that all the operations  are commited or roll back as a unit and maintains the data consistency


Transient,detached-not tracked in database
Managed , re-attached -tracked in database
Removed-marked for deletion in database
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3)Internal working of ORM?

  ORM(Object-Relational Mapping) is a programming techniques that maps a database tables into object-oriented programming constructs.
  It provides abstraction layer between the application code and database tables , allowing developers to work with object instead of raw sql statements.

Internal working of object-relational mapping--

   Mapping-->Query generation-->Data retreival-->Object MAnagement-->Transaction management.

1) Mapping: To map the database tables into the classes of the application code.
         It is done by using configuration files or annotations in the code.
          It specifies how the tables are related to each-other and how the data should be stored and retrived. 

2) Query Generation: once the mapping is placed, the ORM generates the sql Statement based on the objects and their relationships.
                 This is done through query builder or DSL(Domain Specific LAnguage) , allows developers to express their query in a natural way.

3) Data Retrieval: When application code request a data from the database , the ORM translates the object-oriented queries into SQL statements . the results are then transformed back into objects and returned into application code.

4) Object Management: The ORM manages the object in the memory and this includes updating , creating and deleting ojects, as well as catchin the objects to reduce the number of database queries.

5) Transaction Management: The ORM also provides the Transaction management, that allows developers to group multiple .
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------4) Different types of fetching in JPA Hibernate

JPA(Java Persistent API) is a Specification for ORM and Hibernate is implementation of JPA
Hibernate has three fetching strategies
   1)Eager fetching
   2)Lazy fetching
   3)Explicit fetching

1)Eager fetching:--In JPA , it is a default behaviour
              --In eager fetching , related entities are fetched from the database along with primary entites.        
              -- means all the data are retrieved using the single query
             --This is more efficient for small datasets.
            -- specified using "FetchType.EAGER" annotation.

2)Lazy Fetching:
         -- In Lazy Fetching , related entities are not fetched from the database until they are accessed from the application code.
         -- This is more efficient for the large datasets or subsets of the data is needed.
          -- specficies using "FetchType.LAZY" annotation.

3)Explicit Fetching: 
           --In explicit Fetching , the related entities are fetched from the database using the separate query, this is efficient when the related data is needed or the related data is needed to sort in a specific way.
           -- specifies using "@OneToMany(fetch= FetchType.LAZY)" or "@ManyToOne(fetch= FetchType.LAZY)" annotations.


The choice of fetching strategies can have important impact on the behaviour and in application.
  Eager fetching can result in excessive database queries and memory usage, while lazy fetching can result in performance issues if not used properly. 
Explicit fetching can be a good compromise between the two, providing more control over the data that is fetched from the database.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5) Purpose of using association mapping between two or more than two entities

Association Mapping:
          --Association mapping is used in Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) to define the relationships between two or more entities in a database.
          --The main purpose of association mapping is to represent the relationships between entities in a way that is easy to understand and manipulate in object-oriented programming.
        --association mapping is an important tool for creating a well-organized, efficient, and scalable database that can meet the needs of modern applications.

    There are several benefits of using association mapping in ORM:
       --Improves data consistency: Association mapping helps to ensure that data is consistent across related entities, as changes made to one entity will automatically update the related entities.

      --Enhances data retrieval performance: Association mapping allows for the efficient retrieval of data across related entities, which can improve the overall performance of an application. 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------6)MicroServices Overview:
   Microservices architecture is a software development approach that structures an application as a collection of small, independent, and loosely coupled services.
   --Each service is focused on a specific business capability and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently of other services.
  --In a microservices architecture, each service typically runs in its own process and communicates with other services through a lightweight protocol such as HTTP or messaging.
   --microservices architecture can be a powerful approach to building complex software systems, but it requires careful planning, design, and management to be successful.

Some of the key benefits of microservices architecture include:

1. Scalability:
     -- By breaking down an application into smaller, independent services, each service can be scaled up or down independently of the others. This allows the system to be more easily adapted to changing load conditions.

2. Flexibility: 
    --Each service can be developed, deployed, and managed independently, allowing teams to work on different parts of the system at the same time.
    --This can speed up development

 There are also some challenges to using microservices architecture. 
   ---Complexity: Managing a system composed of many independent services can be complex, particularly in terms of coordinating communication and data consistency

   ---Deployment: Deploying and managing many independent services can be more complex
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7)What is Dialect in database configuration?

 Dialect:
  In database configuration, a dialect refers to a specific implementation of a database management system.
  ---A dialect acts as a bridge between the database management system and the application that accesses the database.
  --- It allows the application to communicate with the database by providing the necessary translation between the application's queries and the specific SQL syntax 
   ---For example, if an application uses Hibernate as an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework, the Hibernate dialect is used to communicate with the database. The Hibernate dialect provides the necessary translation between the Hibernate-specific queries and the SQL syntax required by the specific database management system.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8)Discovery server and discovery client server in microservices?
     --In a microservices architecture, a discovery server and discovery client server are used to facilitate communication between services.

     1.Discovery Server:
           --is a centralized registry that stores information about all the available services in the system. 
           -- Each service registers itself with the discovery server, providing information such as its name, IP address, and port number

     2.Discovery Client Server:
           -- is a component within each microservice that allows it to discover and communicate with other services in the system. 
           -- When a microservice needs to communicate with another service, it queries the discovery server for the location of the service it needs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9)Annotations used to make anything a discovery server or client?
  ---In a microservices architecture, annotations can be used to configure a service as a discovery server or a discovery client
  ---The specific annotations used may depend on the technology
  ---annotations provide a simple and easy way to configure a service as a discovery server or a discovery client in a microservices architecture, enabling services to communicate with each other

 Examples of annotations used to configure a service as a discovery server or a discovery client in popular microservices frameworks:

-Spring Cloud - 
         Spring Cloud provides a set of annotations that can be used to enable service discovery and registration in a Spring Boot application.

     To configure a service as a discovery server, the @EnableDiscoveryServer annotation can be used on the main application class. To configure a service as a discovery client, the @EnableDiscoveryClient annotation can be used on the main application class.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------10)Will there be any conflict if we configure in both application.properties and application.yml files? And which file will it take the configuration from first?

-- If the same configuration property is defined in both the application.properties and application.yml files, the configuration value from the application.yml file will take precedence(first) over the configuration value from the application.properties file.

   --For example, if you define a property server.port in both application.properties and application.yml files, the value of server.port in application.yml will be used.

  --it is recommended to use only one configuration file for each application. If you have both application.properties and application.yml files in your application, there may be some confusion about which configuration file is being used for a particular property.

  --if you must use both application.properties and application.yml files, you can use the spring.config.name and spring.config.location properties to specify which configuration files to use. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11) Difference between Hashset and Treeset?
   
   Hashset:--Hashset is a class that implements the set interface.
           -- unordered collection of unique elements.
           -- implemented using hashtable
           -- provides constant-time performance for basic operations such as adding and removing
           --HashSet is particularly useful when you need to quickly check if a value is in a collection without caring about the order in which elements were added. 
           --Example: you might use a HashSet to store a list of unique names, where you need to quickly check if a given name is already in the set.

   Treeset: --TreeSet is a class that implements the sortedSet interface.
            -- it is a collection of unique elements that are sorted in a specific order.
            --TreeSet is particularly useful when you need to maintain the elements in a specific order, such as alphabetical or numerical order
             --Example :  you might use a TreeSet to store a list of unique numbers that need to be sorted in ascending or descending order.

Difference: --Both HashSet and TreeSet are implementations of the Set interface 

Ordering: 
    -HashSet does not maintain any order of its elements
    -TreeSet stores its elements in a sorted order based on their natural ordering

Internal Data Structure:
     -HashSet is implemented using a hash table
     - TreeSet is implemented using a tree data structure 
Null Values:
     - HashSet allows a single null value to be stored
     -TreeSet does not allow null values.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12)What is entryset?
 --the entrySet() method is a part of the Map interface and is used to return a set of all the key-value pairs contained in a map. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
13)How will we do abstraction in java?

abstraction can be achieved through the use of abstract classes and interfaces.

An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own, but must be subclassed by another class. It may contain one or more abstract methods, which are declared but not defined. These methods must be implemented in the subclass that extends the abstract class.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
14)What is default method in interface?
A default method in Java interface is a method that has an implementation in the interface itself. Prior to Java 8, interfaces were only allowed to declare method signatures, but not provide any implementation.

The introduction of default methods in Java 8 allows interfaces to provide a default implementation for a method, which can be used by any class that implements that interface.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
15)Different types of inheritance concepts:
 
Inheritance:
     -- Inheritance in Java is the ability of a subclass to inherit properties and behavior from its superclass.
     -- The subclass can add its own unique properties and behavior as well.
TYPES:
   --Single inheritance: This is the most basic form of inheritance, where a class inherits properties and methods from only one parent class.

   --Multiple inheritance: This is a type of inheritance where a class can inherit properties and methods from multiple parent classes.

   --Hierarchical inheritance: This is a type of inheritance where one parent class is inherited by multiple child classes.

   --Multi-level inheritance: This is a type of inheritance where a class can inherit properties and methods from a parent class, which in turn inherits from another parent class.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
16) Spring and spring boot difference
 
Spring: 
     --Spring is a Java-based framework that provides a comprehensive infrastructure for developing Java applications. 
     --It is one of the most widely used frameworks for building enterprise-level applications, and is known for its modular design, high scalability, and robustness.
 
Features:
    1.Dependency Injection: --mechanism allows developers to easiy manage dependencies between component and classes

    2.Spring MVC:  --Model-View-Controller(MVC) framework for building web applications.

    3.Security:  --Spring provides a robust security framework for securing web applications and other types of applications.

     4.Testing: --Spring provides a powerful testing framework that allows developers to easily write and run unit tests and integration tests.

SpringBoot:
     --extension of the Spring framework that is designed to simplify the process of building and deploying standalone, production-grade Spring-based applications.

features:
    1.Auto-configuration:  --auto-configuration for many of the commonly used Spring libraries and frameworks, reducing the need for manual configuration.

    2.Embedded web server: --Spring Boot comes with an embedded web server (Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow), allowing developers to package applications as self-contained, executable JAR files that can be run directly without an external server.

     3.DevTools: --Spring Boot includes a set of developer tools, such as live reload and automatic restart, to improve developer productivity.

Difference:
    ---Spring and Spring Boot are both Java frameworks used for building enterprise-level applications
    
--Configuration: One of the main differences between Spring and Spring Boot is how they handle configuration. In Spring, developers need to manually configure each component and dependency. In Spring Boot, much of the configuration is done automatically based on sensible defaults, making it much easier and faster to get up and running.

Dependencies: Spring Boot comes with a pre-configured set of dependencies, which reduces the amount of manual configuration required. Spring, on the other hand, requires developers to manually configure dependencies.

Embedded servers: Spring Boot comes with an embedded server (Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow) that allows developers to create self-contained, executable JAR files that can be run directly without any external server. In Spring, developers need to manually configure and deploy the application to an external server.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
17)How will we use different server in spring boot?
    --Spring Boot provides built-in support for several embedded web servers, like Tomcat
     --These servers can be used to run Spring Boot applications as standalone, executable JAR files.
   --To deploy a Spring Boot application to an external server, you can create a WAR file and deploy it to the server as you would with any other web application.

Here are the general steps to deploy a Spring Boot application to an external server:

1.Add the "spring-boot-starter-web" dependency to your project's build file.

2.Create a main class that extends "SpringBootServletInitializer" and override the "configure()" method to register your Spring Boot application.

3.Build a WAR file using your project's build tool (such as Maven or Gradle).

4.Deploy the WAR file to your external server, such as Tomcat.

5.Start the server and access your application using the server's URL.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
18)Layered architecture of a spring boot?
   --Spring Boot is a framework that is based on the principles of modularization and separation of concerns, which are typically implemented using a layered architecture.

The layered architecture of a Spring Boot application typically includes the following layers:

Presentation layer-->Service layer-->Data access layer-->Persistence LAyer-->Infrastructure layer

1.Presentation layer:  
   --This layer is responsible for handling the presentation logic of the application, such as handling user input.
   -- Presentation layer implemented using spring mvc.

2.Service layer:
    --This layer contains the business logic of the application, and is responsible for processing data.
     --implemented using Spring's service-oriented architecture (SOA) features.

3.Data Access layer:
     --This layer is responsible for interacting with the database
     -- implemented using Spring Data, which provides a  API for accessing various types of data sources.

4.Persistence Layer:
      -- This layer is responsible for managing the persistence of data in the database 

      --implemented using an Object Relational Mapping (ORM) framework such as Hibernate.

5.Infrastructure layer: 
         --This layer contains infrastructure components that provide common functionality such as logging, security, and caching.
         -- implemented using various Spring libraries 

the layered architecture of a Spring Boot application provides a clear separation of concerns, making it easier to manage and maintain complex applications

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
19) What is the use of @ControllerAdvice?

  -- @ControllerAdvice is an annotation in Spring Framework used for global exception handling in a Spring MVC application. 
  -- @ControllerAdvice provides a centralized way to handle exceptions in a Spring MVC application, making it easier to maintain and customize error handling logic.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
20)Building blocks of controller class?
     -- a controller class is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and returning an HTTP response to the client

Building blocks are: 
   Class-level annotations-->Request mapping annotations-->Handler methods-->Model attributes-->View name-->Exception handlers-->Response body

1.Class-level annotations:
     --annotations provide metadata about the controller class itself, such as @Controller, which marks the class as a Spring MVC controller.

2.Request mapping annotations: 
      --annotations specify the URL patterns that the controller handles, such as @RequestMapping, @GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping, and @DeleteMapping.

3.Handler methods:
       --These methods handle the incoming HTTP requests and generate the HTTP response.

4.Exception handlers: 
       -- These methods handle exceptions thrown during the execution of the controller. Exception handlers are typically annotated with @ExceptionHandler and specify the exception type that they handle.

5.Response body:
       -- This is the body of the HTTP response returned by the controller. It can be a simple string or a complex object that is serialized to a JSON or XML response.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 21) How will we communicate one microservice with another microservice? 
      --Microservices are designed to be loosely coupled and independently deployable, which means that they communicate with each other over the network using lightweight mechanisms.

     --there are several communication patterns and tools available to communicate one microservice with another microservice.

Synchronous communication , Asynchronous communication  and service discovery.

1.Synchronous communication: 
     --In synchronous communication, a microservice sends a request to another microservice and waits for a response before continuing. This can be done using RESTful APIs or RPC (Remote Procedure Call) frameworks like gRPC.

2.Asynchronous communication:
      -- In asynchronous communication, a microservice sends a message to another microservice without waiting for a response. The receiving microservice can then process the message and send a response back asynchronously.

3.Service discovery: 
        --Service discovery is a mechanism for automatically locating and registering available services in a microservices architecture. Service discovery tools like Netflix Eureka.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
22)If we are not using api gateway, what is the other way? Which method?

   API gateway:
    -- An API Gateway is a reverse proxy that sits at the edge of the microservices architecture and routes incoming requests to the appropriate microservice. It can also handle cross-cutting concerns like security, rate limiting, and authentication.
   
  If you are not using an API Gateway in a microservices architecture, another way to communicate between microservices is by using service-to-service communication. In this approach, each microservice communicates directly with other microservices it depends on.

To implement service to ervice communication are:

1.Direct HTTP calls:
     --Each microservice can expose a set of RESTful endpoints that other microservices can call using HTTP requests
 2. Service registry and discovery:
      --
 3.Messaging 
4. Shared database
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
23)What rest template does? And is there any other way we can communicate other than rest template?

RestTemplate:
    --RestTemplate is a class provided by Spring Framework that simplifies the process of making HTTP requests to external APIs or microservices using RESTful web services.

     --RestTemplate provides several methods for making HTTP requests, such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.

     --RestTemplate can be used in a Spring Boot application to communicate with other microservices.

Yes, there are several other ways to communicate between two systems other than RestTemplate.

1.WebClient: It is a reactive HTTP client introduced in Spring 5.0, which provides a non-blocking and functional API to perform HTTP requests.

2.HTTP Client: It is a Java standard library introduced in Java 11 that provides a lightweight and asynchronous API to perform HTTP requests.

3.Apache HttpClient: It is a widely used Java library that provides a robust and flexible API to perform HTTP requests.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
23)Disadvantages of microservices:
       --Complexity: Microservices architecture is more complex compared to monolithic architecture, as it involves managing multiple services, each with its own codebase, data storage, and communication protocols.
        
       --Distributed Systems: Since microservices are distributed systems, there is an increased risk of network latency, failures, and security vulnerabilities. This makes monitoring and debugging more challenging.

        --Cost: The cost of implementing microservices can be higher, as it requires additional infrastructure, tools, and expertise.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
24)Inversion of control and how it works internally?
    
    Inversion of control (IOC):is a design pattern in software development that promotes loose coupling and modular design.
               -- It is also known as the Dependency Injection (DI) pattern, which refers to the process of injecting dependencies into an object, rather than creating them internally.

Working of IOC:
     IoC means that control of the application's flow is inverted, meaning the framework or container manages the flow instead of the application code. Instead of creating objects themselves, classes delegate the creation and management of dependencies to a framework or container.

Process of IOC:
   The process of IoC works internally by using a container to manage dependencies. The container maintains a registry of available services and the dependencies required by each service. When an object requests a service, the container provides the service and its dependencies.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
25) which annotation is used to for Autoconfiguration?
 
    -- the annotation used for Autoconfiguration is @EnableAutoConfiguration.
    -- @EnableAutoConfiguration is a meta-annotation that enables Spring Boot's auto-configuration mechanism.
    --@EnableAutoConfiguration works in conjunction with @ComponentScan, which scans the packages for annotated components and configures them for use by the application.
    -- @SpringBootApplication annotation is used as a shortcut for @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration, and @ComponentScan.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
26)Stereotype annotations:
     --stereotype annotations" refer to a type of annotation that can be used to mark classes or interfaces with additional information about their intended use or behavior. Stereotype annotations are a way to provide metadata about a class or interface, beyond what is specified by the class or interface itself.

      --Stereotype annotations in Java are typically defined using the "@interface" keyword, followed by the name of the annotation. For example, the following code defines a stereotype annotation called "@Service":

     --stereotype annotations are a useful tool for providing additional context and information about the intended use of a class or interface, and can be used to help ensure that the code is properly organized and structured.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
27)use of Post contruct annotation 
     --the @PostConstruct annotation is a type of stereotype annotation that is used to mark a method that should be executed immediately after a bean is constructed and its dependencies have been injected.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
28)Bean and component annotation
     --the Bean and Component annotations are used to indicate that a class should be managed by the Spring container.

@Bean---The Bean annotation is used to explicitly declare a bean, which is an object that Spring manages, initializes, and injects into other objects. When you annotate a class with @Bean, Spring will treat that class as a factory method for creating an instance of the class, which can be injected into other classes.

@Component--- the Component annotation is used to declare a class as a Spring-managed component, which means that Spring will create an instance of the class and manage its lifecycle. The Component annotation is often used for classes that represent a single logical unit in your application, such as a controller, service, or repository.

Difference:
   --Bean annotation is used for factory methods that create objects, while the Component annotation is used for classes that represent a logical unit in your application.

    --@Bean is used to declare a single bean, which is a Spring-managed object, that will be created and configured by the Spring container. It is typically used to declare a specific instance of a class, with explicit configuration provided by the user.
java

     --@Component is used to mark a class as a Spring-managed component. It is a generic annotation that is applied to classes, indicating that they are candidates for Spring’s component scanning process. The component scanning process will find and instantiate all the classes annotated with @Component and manage their lifecycle.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
29) We have two pojo classes. One is entity and other is not. How to use the other class as has-a relationship in entity class without any other?

    If you want to use the other class as a has-a relationship in the entity class without any other classes, you can simply create an instance variable of the other class within the entity class.

For example, suppose you have a class called Person that represents a person entity and another class called Address that represents a person's address. You can define the Person class as follows:

     public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;
    private Address address;

    // constructors, getters, setters, etc.
}

In this example, the Person class has an instance variable address of type Address, which represents the person's address. This is a has-a relationship between the Person and Address classes.

You can then create instances of the Person and Address classes and set the address variable of the Person object to the corresponding Address object, like this:

Address address = new Address("123 Main St", "Anytown", "USA");
Person person = new Person("John Doe", 30, address);

This creates a Person object with the name "John Doe", age 30, and address "123 Main St, Anytown, USA".
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

30)How will we name any microservices using application.properties or application.yml?
We can specify the name of a microservice using the spring.application.name property in either the application.properties or application.yml file.

For example, if you have a microservice that provides user authentication, you can set its name to "authentication-service" as follows:

# application.properties
spring.application.name=authentication-service

or

# application.yml
spring:
  application:
    name: authentication-service

The spring.application.name property is used by Spring Boot to register the microservice with the discovery server (if you are using one), and also to generate the application's endpoint URL.

By default, the endpoint URL for a microservice is based on its name, so setting the spring.application.name property is important if you want to ensure that your microservice can be discovered and accessed correctly by other services in your system.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
31)Dependency Injection (DI):

   DI is a powerful technique that can improve the quality and maintainability of software systems, making them more flexible, robust, and easy to work with.

1. Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used in software engineering that involves separating the construction and use of objects. In DI, objects are not responsible for creating or obtaining their dependencies on their own, but instead rely on an external entity (usually a framework or container) to provide them with the necessary dependencies.

2.The main idea behind DI is to reduce the coupling between classes and improve their maintainability, testability, and reusability.

3.DI makes it easier to modify or replace dependencies without affecting the rest of the system. This also makes it easier to write unit tests for classes, as dependencies can be mocked or stubbed, allowing for better isolation and more focused testing.

4.There are several ways to implement DI, including constructor injection, setter injection, and interface injection. 

5.Constructor injection involves passing dependencies to a class through its constructor. Setter injection involves using setter methods to inject dependencies into a class. Interface injection involves defining an interface for dependency injection and having classes implement that interface.

6.DI frameworks and containers such as Spring, Guice, and Dagger provide a convenient way to manage dependencies in large-scale applications. These frameworks allow you to define dependencies in a centralized configuration file and automatically wire them up to the objects that need them.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
32) Why is dependency injection is used?

The main idea behind DI is that objects should not create or obtain their dependencies on their own, but instead rely on an external entity (usually a framework or container) to provide them with the necessary dependencies. This external entity is responsible for instantiating and managing the dependencies, and injecting them into the object that needs them.

Here are some of the benefits of using DI:

1.Decoupling: DI helps to reduce the coupling between classes, making it easier to modify or replace dependencies without affecting the rest of the system.

2.Testability: DI makes it easier to write unit tests for classes, as dependencies can be mocked or stubbed, allowing for better isolation and more focused testing.

3.Reusability: DI promotes the reuse of components, as they can be easily
swapped in and out of different applications or contexts.

4.Flexibility: DI allows for more flexibility in the configuration and behavior of objects, as dependencies can be swapped out or customized without modifying the code of the dependent objects.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
33)Types of SOLID principles
   --SOLID principles are an object-oriented approach that are applied to software structure design.

   -- It also ensures that the software is modular, easy to understand, debug, and refactor

  he word SOLID acronym for:

1.Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
2.Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
3.Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
4.Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
5.Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

1.Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):

--The single responsibility principle states that every Java class must perform a single functionality.
-- Implementation of multiple functionalities in a single class mashup the code and if any modification is required may affect the whole class. 
--It precise the code and the code can be easily maintained.

2.Open-Closed Principle (OCP)

--Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
--This means that new functionality should be added by adding new code instead of changing existing code. 
--This principle promotes code reuse, reduces the risk of introducing bugs, and makes the code easier to maintain.

3.Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
--It applies to inheritance in such a way that the derived classes must be completely substitutable for their base classes. 
--In other words, if class A is a subtype of class B, then we should be able to replace B with A without interrupting the behavior of the program.

--It extends the open-close principle and also focuses on the behavior of a superclass and its subtypes. We should design the classes to preserve the property unless we have a strong reason to do otherwise.

4.Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):

--The principle states that the larger interfaces split into smaller ones. Because the implementation classes use only the methods that are required. 
--We should not force the client to use the methods that they do not want to use.

--The goal of the interface segregation principle is similar to the single responsibility principle. 

5.Dependency Inversion Principle:
  --High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. 
--Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions. 
--This principle promotes decoupling, which leads to more flexible and scalable code.

the SOLID principles provide a set of guidelines for creating maintainable, flexible, and scalable software. By following these principles, developers can create code that is easier to understand, modify, and extend over time.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
34)Factory design pattern


The Factory design pattern is a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. In other words, the Factory pattern provides an abstraction over the process of creating objects, allowing you to create objects without specifying their exact class.

The Factory pattern consists of four components:

1.Product: This is the interface or abstract class that defines the objects to be created.

2.Concrete Product: These are the classes that implement the Product interface and define the specific objects to be created.

3.Creator: This is the abstract class that defines the factory method, which creates the Product objects.

4.Concrete Creator: These are the classes that implement the Creator interface and override the factory method to create specific Concrete Product objects.

The Factory pattern provides several benefits, including:

1.Encapsulation: The Factory pattern encapsulates the creation of objects, allowing the client to create objects without knowing the exact class of the object being created.

2.Flexibility: The Factory pattern provides flexibility in creating objects, allowing subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

3.Decoupling: The Factory pattern decouples the client from the implementation of the objects being created, which reduces the complexity of the client code.

4.Testability: The Factory pattern makes it easier to test the client code, as the client code does not need to instantiate the objects directly.

Some common examples of the Factory pattern in practice include creating instances of database connections, creating instances of different types of user interface components, and creating instances of different types of logging classes.

Overall, the Factory pattern is a useful pattern for creating objects in a flexible, maintainable, and scalable way.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
34)Lifecycle of bean:

a bean is a managed object that is instantiated, configured, and managed by the Spring IoC container. The lifecycle of a bean in Spring can be divided into several phases, as follows:

1.Instantiation: The container creates an instance of the bean by calling the bean's constructor.

2.Dependency Injection: The container injects the necessary dependencies into the bean. This can be done using constructor injection, setter injection, or field injection.

3.Initialization: The container calls the bean's @PostConstruct annotated method, if one exists, and performs any other necessary initialization tasks.

4.Usage: The bean is now ready to be used by the application.

5.Destruction: When the application no longer needs the bean, the container calls the bean's @PreDestroy annotated method, if one exists, and performs any necessary cleanup tasks.

It's important to note that Spring provides several ways to manage the lifecycle of a bean, including:

1.Scopes: Spring provides several scopes for beans, including Singleton, Prototype, Request, Session, and others. Scopes define how long a bean should live and how many instances of a bean should be created.

2.Events: Spring provides an event mechanism that allows beans to publish events and receive events. This mechanism can be used to handle lifecycle events, as well as other events in the application.

3.AOP: Spring's Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) framework provides a way to intercept and modify the behavior of beans at runtime. This can be used to add lifecycle behavior, such as logging or caching.

Overall, the lifecycle of a bean in Spring is managed by the Spring IoC container, which provides a rich set of features for managing bean instantiation, configuration, and destruction. By understanding the lifecycle of a bean in Spring, developers can create more efficient, scalable, and maintainable applications.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
35)What is application context?

the ApplicationContext is the central interface for providing configuration information to the Spring IoC container. It is a container that holds all the beans in the application and provides a way to access them. The ApplicationContext is responsible for creating, initializing, and wiring the beans together.

The ApplicationContext provides several features, including:

1.Dependency Injection: The ApplicationContext uses Dependency Injection to wire the beans together, allowing them to collaborate with each other.

2.Configuration Management: The ApplicationContext provides a way to manage the configuration of the application, including loading properties files and other configuration files.

3.Lifecycle Management: The ApplicationContext manages the lifecycle of the beans in the application, including creating, initializing, and destroying them.

4.AOP Support: The ApplicationContext provides support for Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP), which can be used to add cross-cutting concerns, such as logging or caching, to the application.

5.The ApplicationContext is an extension of the BeanFactory interface, which provides basic support for dependency injection and lifecycle management. However, the ApplicationContext provides many additional features, including support for internationalization, message resolution, and application events.

Overall, the ApplicationContext is a powerful container that provides a way to manage the beans in a Spring application, including their configuration, dependencies, and lifecycle. By using the ApplicationContext, developers can create flexible, modular, and scalable applications that are easy to maintain and extend.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
36)Exception propagation?

Exception propagation refers to the process of passing an exception up the call stack, from a method where it was thrown to the method that called it, and eventually to the top-level of the program where it can be handled.

  exception propagation is an important mechanism for handling errors in Java programs. By propagating exceptions up the call stack, errors can be handled at the appropriate level of abstraction, based on the context in which they occur.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
37)Different exceptions if they are runtime or compile classcast, io, filenotfound, interrupted?

Exception:an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. Exceptions are used to handle errors, unexpected conditions, and other exceptional situations that can occur during program execution.

 exceptions can be divided into two broad categories: checked exceptions and unchecked exceptions.

1.Checked exceptions are exceptions that are checked by the compiler at compile-time, and must either be caught or declared in the method signature using the throws keyword. Some common checked exceptions are:

IOException: This is a checked exception that is thrown when an I/O operation fails or is interrupted, such as when reading or writing to a file or socket.
FileNotFoundException: This is a subclass of IOException that is thrown when an attempt is made to access a file that does not exist.
InterruptedException: This is a checked exception that is thrown when a thread is interrupted while it is sleeping or waiting.
Unchecked exceptions, on the other hand, are exceptions that are not checked by the compiler, and can be caught or propagated up the call stack at runtime. Some common unchecked exceptions are:

ClassCastException: This is an unchecked exception that is thrown when an attempt is made to cast an object to a type that it is not compatible with.
NullPointerException: This is an unchecked exception that is thrown when a null reference is used in a method that does not allow nulls.
RuntimeException: This is a superclass of many common unchecked exceptions, such as NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, and ArithmeticException. These exceptions are typically caused by programming errors, such as accessing an array index out of bounds or dividing by zero.
It's worth noting that some exceptions can be both checked and unchecked, depending on the context in which they are used. For example, NullPointerException is an unchecked exception when it is caused by a programming error, but it can also be a checked exception when it is thrown intentionally by a method that requires a non-null parameter.

In summary, exceptions in Java can be divided into two broad categories: checked exceptions and unchecked exceptions. Checked exceptions are checked by the compiler at compile-time, while unchecked exceptions are not. Some common exceptions include ClassCastException, IOException, FileNotFoundException, InterruptedException, and RuntimeException.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
36)Lambda Expression and Funtional interface:

Functional Interface:
     a functional interface is an interface that has exactly one abstract method. A functional interface is also known as a SAM (Single Abstract Method) type. Java 8 introduced functional interfaces as a way to support lambda expressions and method references, which are used to implement functional programming concepts in Java.

Lambda Expression:

A lambda expression is a concise way to represent an anonymous function, which can be passed as an argument to another method or assigned to a variable. Lambda expressions are often used in conjunction with functional interfaces to provide a simple and flexible way to write functional-style code in Java.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
37)Ways to implement abstract methods in functional interface other than lambda expressions?

In addition to lambda expressions, there are a few other ways to implement the abstract method of a functional interface in Java. These include:

Anonymous inner classes: You can define an anonymous inner class that implements the functional interface and provides an implementation for its abstract method. 

For example:


Calculator add = new Calculator() {
    @Override
    public int calculate(int x, int y) {
        return x + y;
    }
};

Here, we have defined an anonymous inner class that implements the Calculator functional interface and provides an implementation for its calculate method.

Method references: If the implementation of the abstract method of a functional interface is a method in another class, you can use a method reference to pass that method as an argument. For example:
java
Copy code
Calculator add = Integer::sum;
Here, we have used a method reference to the Integer.sum method, which takes two integers as arguments and returns their sum. The sum method has the same signature as the calculate method of the Calculator functional interface, so it can be used to implement it.

Inner classes: You can define a regular inner class that implements the functional interface and provides an implementation for its abstract method. For example:
java
Copy code
public class AddCalculator implements Calculator {
    @Override
    public int calculate(int x, int y) {
        return x + y;
    }
}

Calculator add = new AddCalculator();
Here, we have defined a regular inner class called AddCalculator that implements the Calculator functional interface and provides an implementation for its calculate method. We then create an instance of the AddCalculator class and assign it to the add variable.

While lambda expressions are the most concise and expressive way to implement the abstract method of a functional interface, these other techniques can be useful in certain situations, such as when you need to provide more complex or reusable implementations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
38)Intermediate and terminal operations in stream api?

The Stream API provides a way to work with collections and data sets in a more concise and functional way. Streams are essentially pipelines of data that allow you to perform operations on the data in a declarative way.

There are two types of operations that can be performed on a stream:

1.Intermediate Operations: Intermediate operations are operations that are applied to a stream before the final result is computed. These operations return a new stream that can be used for further operations. Some examples of intermediate operations are filter, map, flatMap, distinct, sorted, and peek.

2.Terminal Operations: Terminal operations are operations that are applied to a stream to produce a final result or side effect. These operations cause the stream to be consumed, which means that you can no longer use the stream for further operations. Some examples of terminal operations are count, collect, forEach, reduce, and anyMatch.

Intermediate operations are lazy, which means that they are not executed until a terminal operation is called on the stream. This allows you to perform complex data transformations and filter operations without actually modifying the original data. 

erminal operations, on the other hand, are eager, which means that they execute the entire stream pipeline and produce a final result or side effect.

By using intermediate and terminal operations together, you can create powerful data transformations and computations in a declarative and functional way.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
39)Types of casting?

  there are two types of casting:

        1.Implicit Casting
        2.Explicit Casting

1.Implicit casting happens automatically when a value of a smaller data type is assigned to a variable of a larger data type. For example, if you assign an integer value to a variable of type long, the integer value will be implicitly cast to a long. Implicit casting can be performed for primitive data types as well as for object types.

2.Explicit casting is when you manually convert a value of one data type to another data type. This is necessary when you want to assign a value of a larger data type to a variable of a smaller data type. However, when you do this, you risk losing information because the value may not fit within the range of the smaller data type.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
40)Upcasting and downcasting?
    Upcasting:

Upcasting is the process of converting a reference variable of a subclass to a reference variable of its superclass. This is an implicit conversion because it happens automatically. Upcasting is safe and does not require an explicit cast because the subclass object can always be treated as its superclass object.

  Downcasting:
Downcasting is the process of converting a reference variable of a superclass to a reference variable of its subclass. This is an explicit conversion because it requires a cast operator. Downcasting is not always safe because the superclass object may not be an instance of its subclass.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
41)Is it possible to override default methods?
    Yes, it is possible to override default methods in Java. When a class implements an interface that has a default method, the class can choose to override that method with its own implementation.

If a subclass also implements the same interface and provides its own implementation of the default method, then the subclass implementation will be used instead of the default implementation provided by the interface.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
42)There are 2 interfaces, we want to substitute one of the subclass implementation of that
interface. Interface1 and Interface2 are there which are implemented in subclass ClassA. Can
we substitute only for interface1 only without implementing both?

 
In Java, if a class implements two interfaces that have methods with the same signature (i.e., methods with the same name, parameter types, and return type), then the class must provide its own implementation of that method to avoid a compilation error.

If you want to substitute the implementation of only one of the interfaces implemented by a class, you can create a new class that extends the original class and provides a new implementation of the method for the interface you want to substitute.

For example, consider a subclass ClassA that implements both Interface1 and Interface2:

public class ClassA implements Interface1, Interface2 {
    // Implementation of methods for Interface1 and Interface2
}

If you want to substitute the implementation of Interface1, you can create a new class ClassB that extends ClassA and provides a new implementation of the method for Interface1. In this way, you can reuse the implementation of Interface2 provided by ClassA.

public class ClassB extends ClassA implements Interface1 {
    // New implementation of the method for Interface1
}

Now, you can use ClassB wherever you want to substitute the implementation of Interface1, and use ClassA wherever you want to use the original implementation of both Interface1 and Interface2.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
42)JVM, JDK, and JRE
  JVM provides the runtime environment for Java programs, JRE provides the runtime environment and libraries required to run Java applications, and JDK includes the development tools and compilers required to develop Java applications.

JVM:

   JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine, which is an abstract machine that provides the runtime environment for Java programs to run. JVM is responsible for interpreting the compiled Java bytecode and executing it on the host machine. It provides various services such as memory management, security, and exception handling. JVM is available for different operating systems, making Java programs platform-independent.

JRE:

JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment, which includes the JVM, libraries, and other components required to run Java applications. JRE does not include the development tools and compilers that are included in the JDK.

JDK:
JDK stands for Java Development Kit, which includes the JRE as well as development tools such as compilers, debuggers, and other utilities required to develop Java applications. JDK is used by developers to write, compile, and run Java programs.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
43)Java does not support pointers but why do we get null pointer exceptions?

Although Java does not have explicit pointers like in languages such as C or C++, it does have references, which are similar to pointers in that they refer to objects in memory.

A null pointer exception occurs when a reference variable is attempting to access an object, but the variable has a null value (i.e., it is not pointing to any object). In other words, the reference variable is pointing to nothing or is uninitialized.

For example, consider the following code:

String str = null;
System.out.println(str.length());

In this code, the str variable is initialized to null, which means it does not point to any object. When we attempt to call the length() method on the str variable, a null pointer exception will occur because the variable is not pointing to any object.

In summary, null pointer exceptions can occur in Java when a reference variable is attempting to access an object, but the variable has a null value. This is not related to the absence of explicit pointers in Java.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
44)StringBuffer and StringBuilder difference. Which is better?

StringBuffer:
   StringBuffer is a class in Java that represents a mutable sequence of characters. It provides methods for modifying the contents of the string without creating a new object.

StringBuffer is similar to the String class, but it is mutable, which means that you can append, insert, delete, or replace characters in the string without creating a new object. This is useful in situations where you need to modify a string frequently, as creating new objects can be inefficient in terms of memory usage and performance.

One important thing to note about StringBuffer is that it is thread-safe, which means that it can be used safely in multi-threaded environments. This is because StringBuffer methods are synchronized, which ensures that only one thread can access the buffer at a time.

StringBuilder:
   StringBuilder is a class in Java that represents a mutable sequence of characters, similar to StringBuffer. However, unlike StringBuffer, StringBuilder is not thread-safe.

Like StringBuffer, StringBuilder provides methods for modifying the contents of the string without creating a new object. It is useful for situations where you need to modify a string frequently, but you do not need thread-safety.

StringBuilder is not thread-safe, it is faster and more efficient than StringBuffer in single-threaded applications. However, in multi-threaded applications, it is important to use StringBuffer instead of StringBuilder to ensure thread-safety.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
45)Constructor chaining:
   
    Constructor chaining is the process of calling one constructor from another constructor in the same class or in the superclass hierarchy. This is a way to reuse code and avoid duplication when multiple constructors need to perform the same tasks.

 we can chain constructors using the this keyword or the super keyword.

public class MyClass {
   private String name;
   private int age;

   public MyClass() {
       this("John Doe", 25); // calls the other constructor with default values
   }

   public MyClass(String name) {
       this(name, 25); // calls the other constructor with default age
   }

   public MyClass(String name, int age) {
       this.name = name;
       this.age = age;
   }
}

In this example, there are three constructors in the MyClass class. The first constructor calls the second constructor using this, and the second constructor calls the third constructor using this. This way, all constructors eventually call the third constructor, which is where the actual initialization code is located.

Note that you can also chain constructors in the superclass hierarchy using the super keyword. When you do this, the superclass constructor is called before the subclass constructor.

Constructor chaining can make your code more concise and maintainable by avoiding duplication of initialization code. However, it can also make your code harder to read and debug, especially if the chaining is complex or involves multiple classes. Therefore, you should use constructor chaining judiciously, and make sure that your code is easy to understand and maintain.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
46)can we use super and this method in same constructor?
   Yes, you can use both super and this in the same constructor to chain constructors in the superclass hierarchy and the same class respectively.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
47)Can we make class final and extend it?
  
No, you cannot extend a class that has been declared as final. When a class is declared as final, it means that it cannot be subclassed or extended by any other class. This is often used to prevent the class from being modified or overridden by other developers.

If you try to extend a final class, you will get a compilation error.

So, if you want to allow other developers to extend your class, you should not declare it as final. However, if you want to prevent your class from being modified or extended, you can declare it as final.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
48)How to make a class immutable?

To make a class immutable, you need to follow these guidelines:

1.Declare the class as final so that it cannot be extended or subclassed.
2.Declare all the fields as private and final to prevent them from being modified after initialization.
3.Do not provide any setter methods for the fields. Instead, initialize the fields in the constructor or using static factory methods.
4.If any of the fields are mutable, such as collections or arrays, create defensive copies of them to prevent them from being modified outside the class.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
49)What is feign client in spring boot?

Feign client is a declarative HTTP client for Spring Boot applications that simplifies the process of making HTTP requests to external services. It uses annotations to define the interface of the REST endpoint and then generates the implementation code at runtime.

With Feign client, you can define an interface that describes the API of the remote service, including the URL, request parameters, HTTP headers, and HTTP method. Feign client takes care of making the HTTP request to the remote service and marshalling the response back to your application.

By using Feign client, you can simplify the process of making HTTP requests to external services and avoid boilerplate code for handling HTTP requests and responses.

1.First, you need to add the Feign client dependency to your Spring Boot project
2.Next, you need to enable Feign client in your Spring Boot application by annotating your main class with @EnableFeignClients
3.Then, you can define an interface that describes the API of the remote service using the @FeignClient and @RequestMapping annotations
4.Finally, you can use the Feign client in your code by autowiring the interface and invoking its methods
-------------------------------------------------------------------------50)How to handle heavy loads or traffic in microservice?

Handling heavy loads or traffic in microservices can be a challenging task.

Some of the strategies are: LoadBalancing , Caching , Circuit Breakers
Auto Scaling , Asynchronous processing , Resilient communication


1.Load balancing: Implementing load balancing can help distribute the traffic across multiple instances of a microservice. This can be achieved using software load balancers such as Nginx, HAProxy or using cloud-based load balancers.

2.Caching: Caching frequently accessed data can help reduce the load on microservices. This can be achieved using in-memory caches such as Redis or Memcached.

3.Circuit breakers: Implementing circuit breakers can help prevent cascading failures in microservices. Circuit breakers monitor the health of microservices and, if they detect a failure, break the circuit and prevent further requests from being sent to the failing service.

4.Autoscaling: Autoscaling can help ensure that the microservices infrastructure can handle varying loads. Autoscaling can be done horizontally, by adding more instances of a microservice, or vertically, by increasing the resources allocated to each instance.

5.Asynchronous processing: Implementing asynchronous processing can help reduce the load on microservices by offloading tasks to background jobs or queues. This can be achieved using messaging systems such as RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka.

6.Resilient communication: Implementing resilient communication can help ensure that microservices can communicate with each other even when some of them are experiencing issues. This can be achieved using protocols such as HTTP with retry and timeout mechanisms, or using message-based communication.

Overall, the key is to design microservices that are scalable, fault-tolerant, and resilient, and to implement strategies that can help handle heavy loads or traffic.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
51)Where will we annotate load balancer in microservice?
  
In a microservice architecture, load balancing is typically implemented using a software load balancer such as Nginx, HAProxy, or using cloud-based load balancers such as AWS ELB or Azure Load Balancer.

To use a load balancer in a microservice, you can configure the load balancer to distribute traffic across multiple instances of the microservice. Each instance of the microservice will typically be running on a separate server or container.

In a microservice architecture, load balancing is typically implemented using a software load balancer such as Nginx, HAProxy, or using cloud-based load balancers such as AWS ELB or Azure Load Balancer.

To use a load balancer in a microservice, you can configure the load balancer to distribute traffic across multiple instances of the microservice. Each instance of the microservice will typically be running on a separate server or container.

@Bean
@LoadBalanced
public RestTemplate restTemplate() {
    return new RestTemplate();
}

This will create a RestTemplate bean that is load-balanced using the default load balancer (e.g., Ribbon). Then, you can use this RestTemplate bean to make requests to other microservices, and the load balancer will distribute the requests across the available instances of the microservice.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
