Abstraction:

For example : If we creating a class called motorbike we dont really need to understand what is happening inside in motorbike 
It's sufficient if we know that,this is the key,I would need to put it in and start my bike and I would be able to use the gears and accelerators.
we dont really need to understand what is happening inside in engine and al kind of stuffs.

This is exactly the same concept that comes to programming ,
here we are writing the java program, we not writing machine code nad we not really wrting zeros and ones like that  all that kind of job is abstracted away

we write java codes behind the screens the code is compiled , bute code is generated , and its run on the JVM.

So, all that kind of things is abstracted away from us.

That is called abstraction.

Encapsulation: hiding the data that is belonging to a specific object.

we would only allow operations to be performed. we will not allow access to the data, that's Encapsulation.

Abstraction: We try to hide all the complexities .
