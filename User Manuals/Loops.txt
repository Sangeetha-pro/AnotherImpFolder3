Loops:-Loop Statements help you to repeat code execution.

A loop is used to run same code again and again.

FOR LOOP : --Used to iterate a specific number of times
    
For Loop is used to loop code specified number of times.

SYNTAX:

for (initialization; condition; iteration) { // code to be executed }

for (int i=0; i<=10 ; i++){
  System.out.println(i);
}

The condition should be true only then the loop will get executed.

for (initialisation ; condition ; update)

 each one of these part can be empty.



------------------------------------------

WHILE LOOP:--Repeatedly execute a block of code while a condition is true
       
while (condition){
System.out.println();
i++;
}

while is similar to if statement

here, the difference between while and if is
if is executed only once.
while will execute  multiple times.

In while we have to increment the value.
If increment is not done in while loop it will be infinite.

int i=-2;

while (i<5){
System.out.println(i);
i++;
}

output:
-2
-1           
0
1
2
3
4

The code in the while gets exceuted until the condition mets.

When we use while loop?

we will use while loop , when we dont know how many times it will print.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DO-WHILE LOOP: -- Executes the code block once before checking the condition

do{
System.out.println(i + "")
i++;
} while (i<5);
 
The major difference between the WHILE & DO-WHILE LOOP:

The code in the Do-While loop will execute atleast once , Even when the condition is not met also.
But in while loop we will check the condition first , if the condition is not met, the code will not gets excuted.

-------------------------------------------------

BREAK AND CONTINUE:

Break :  --Used to exit a loop or a switch statement

Break will break the loop when the condition is met.
Break statement inside the loop will completely take outside from the specific loop.


Break takes competely out of the loop.
----------------------------------------

Continue: -Used to skip over one iteration of a loop

It does not break out of the loop , But it goes on next iteration of the loop.

Continue will continue the loop but next part of the iteration is completely skipped.

-----------------------------------------
Choosing a loop:

1.Do you know how many times to run?

FOR LOOP

2.Do yo when to end the loop?

WHILE LOOP
For Example: user is entering a list of values.So, we would want to run the loop until user enters a specific kind of values or
you want to process a list of numbers until you want to encounter a negative number or until you want to see a odd number or want to process the list until to see the prime numbers.

IN all thes situations we don't know how many times the loop would run.
We want to nd a loop based on a specific condition

In these situation we have to go with WHILE or DO-WHILE LOOP.

3.Do you want to execute the loop atleast once?

DO-WHILE
