what is cloud computing?
cloud computing allows users to access and use computing resources and services over the internet without needing to own or maintain physical infrastructure.
======================================
1.3 basic types of cloud computing?

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
 In IaaS, cloud providers offer virtualized computing resources over the internet. This includes virtual machines, storage, and networking. Users can deploy and manage their own operating systems, applications, and development frameworks. Examples of IaaS providers include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Compute Engine.


Platform as a Service (PaaS)
 PaaS provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the underlying infrastructure. It typically includes development tools, databases

Software as a Service (SaaS)
 SaaS delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis. Users access these applications through a web browser or API without needing to install or maintain the software locally. Common examples of SaaS include email services like Gmail
====================================================
2.Similarity between availability zone and regions:
Azs:Availability Zones are distinct locations within a single geographical region provided by a cloud service provider.
Each Availability Zone typically consists of one or more data centers, with redundant power, networking, and connectivity.
They allow users to distribute their applications and data across multiple physical locations for better resilience.

Regions:
Regions are separate geographic areas in which cloud service providers operate their infrastructure.
Each region consists of multiple Availability Zones, which are isolated from each other to minimize the impact of failures or disruptions.

Similarity: Both Availability Zones and Regions are designed to enhance redundancy and resilience by providing multiple isolated locations for deploying applications and storing data. This helps ensure high availability and fault tolerance.
================================================
3.what is autoscaling?
Autoscaling is a feature in cloud computing that allows automatic adjustment of computational resources based on the current workload or demand. It enables applications to dynamically scale up or down their resource allocation in response to changes in traffic, without requiring manual intervention. Here's how it typically works:

Scale-Out: When demand increases, and resources are approaching capacity limits, autoscaling automatically adds more resources, such as launching additional virtual servers or containers.
Scale-In: Conversely, when demand decreases, and resources are underutilized, autoscaling removes excess resources to optimize cost and efficiency. This might involve terminating unnecessary instances or deallocating resources.
=================================================
4.services in aws
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2): Provides resizable compute capacity in the form of virtual servers (instances).
Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3): Object storage service for storing and retrieving data.
Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS): Managed relational database service supporting various database engines like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server.
AWS CodeDeploy: Automates code deployments to EC2 instances, on-premises servers
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM): Helps you securely control access to AWS services and resources.
====================================================
5.EC2 instance?
An EC2 instance is a virtual server provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS)
allowing users to run applications and workloads on virtual machines in the cloud.
EC2 instances provide a flexible, scalable, and cost-effective solution for running a wide range of applications and workloads in the cloud.
=================================================
6.what is subnet?

a subnet refers to a subdivision of an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). AWS allows users to create virtual networks called VPCs, which are isolated from other VPCs and the internet by default

Public Subnets: Public subnets are configured with a route to the internet gateway, allowing instances within the subnet to communicate directly with the internet. Public subnets are typically used for resources that need to be accessible from the internet, such as web servers.
Private Subnets: Private subnets are not directly accessible from the internet. They do not have a route to the internet gateway by default. Instances in private subnets can communicate with other resources within the same VPC or with resources in other VPCs connected via VPC peering, VPN, or AWS Direct Connect. Private subnets are commonly used for backend databases or application servers that do not require direct internet access.

Imagine you have a big piece of land, like a farm. This is your VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) in AWS. Now, within that land, you want to divide it into smaller sections to organize things better. These smaller sections are your subnets.

Each subnet is like a separate plot within your farm. You give each plot a specific size, like how many IP addresses it can have. This is called a CIDR block. So, one plot might have space for 10 devices, while another can fit 20.

Now, let's say you want to make sure your farm is safe and can handle any situation. You decide to split it into different areas, like one for crops, one for animals, and one for your house. These are your Availability Zones (AZs) in AWS.

In your farm, you might have some areas that everyone can access, like the entrance where visitors come in. These are your public subnets in AWS. But then, you might have areas where only you and your family can go, like your backyard. These are your private subnets in AWS.

To keep everything organized, you create paths (routes) between different areas. You might have a path from the animal area to the crops area, but not from the animal area to your house. These paths are managed by route tables in AWS.

Lastly, you want to make sure your farm is secure. You put up fences and gates (security groups and network ACLs) around each plot to control who can come in and out.

So, in simpler terms, subnets in AWS are like dividing your farm into smaller sections, each with its own size, purpose, and level of access. They help you organize, secure, and manage your resources effectively.
==================================================
7.In security group , what is ssh traffic in aws?

In AWS, SSH traffic refers to Secure Shell traffic. Secure Shell (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol used for secure communication over an unsecured network. It provides a secure channel for accessing and managing remote servers or instances.
enabling SSH traffic in an AWS security group allows you to securely access and manage your instances over the internet, providing a convenient and reliable method for remote administration and troubleshooting.

56.how we recover the deleted instance?
Accidentally Terminated Instance with EBS Volume Persistence:
If you have configured your EBS volumes to persist after instance termination (using the "DeleteOnTermination" attribute), the associated EBS volumes will still exist after terminating the instance.
You can recover the instance by launching a new EC2 instance and attaching the existing EBS volumes to it.

Accidentally Deleted Instance without EBS Volume Persistence:

If the associated EBS volumes were deleted along with the instance, you may still be able to recover data if you have enabled EBS snapshots or backups.
Check if there are any snapshots or backups of the EBS volumes associated with the deleted instance.
If snapshots or backups exist, you can create new EBS volumes from the snapshots or backups and attach them to a new EC2 instance.
=====================================================================================================================================================
57.can we assure our data is secured in aws environment?

61.how load balancers work?
Load balancers distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers or backend resources to ensure high availability, reliability, and scalability of applications. Here's how load balancers typically work:

Client Request:

When a client sends a request to access a web application or service, such as accessing a website or making an API call, the request is directed to the load balancer's domain name or IP address.
Load Balancer:

The load balancer receives the incoming request and forwards it to one of the backend servers or resources based on a predefined load balancing algorithm.
The load balancer may perform health checks on the backend servers to ensure they are available and healthy before forwarding traffic to them.
==================================================================================================================================================
62.how do recover terminated ec2 instance?
ecovering a terminated EC2 instance depends on whether the associated EBS volumes were deleted along with the instance or if they were retained after termination. Here's how you can recover a terminated EC2 instance in both scenarios:

Retaining EBS Volumes after Termination:

If you have configured your EBS volumes to persist after instance termination (by deselecting the "Delete on Termination" option), the associated EBS volumes will still exist after terminating the instance.
To recover the terminated instance:
Go to the EC2 dashboard in the AWS Management Console.
Click on "Instances" from the left sidebar to view the list of instances.
If the terminated instance is still listed, select it and choose "Actions" > "Instance State" > "Start" to restart the instance.
If the instance is no longer listed, you can launch a new EC2 instance and attach the existing EBS volumes manually.
Navigate to "Volumes" from the left sidebar to find the EBS volumes associated with the terminated instance.
Select the desired EBS volumes, choose "Actions" > "Attach Volume," and select the newly launched instance to attach the volumes to it.
After attaching the volumes, you may need to mount and configure them within the operating system of the instance to access the data.
Deleted EBS Volumes after Termination:

If the associated EBS volumes were deleted along with the instance, you may still be able to recover data if you have snapshots or backups of the volumes.
To recover the terminated instance:
Go to the EC2 dashboard in the AWS Management Console.
Navigate to "Snapshots" from the left sidebar to find and restore snapshots of the deleted EBS volumes.
Create new EBS volumes from the snapshots.
Launch a new EC2 instance and attach the newly created EBS volumes to it.
After attaching the volumes, you may need to mount and configure them within the operating system of the instance to access the data.

70.rule of s3 bucket in aws?
Bucket Names:

Bucket names must be globally unique across all of AWS.
Bucket names can contain letters, numbers, hyphens, and periods, with certain restrictions.
Bucket names cannot be modified after creation.
Bucket Policies:

Bucket policies are JSON-based access control policies that define permissions for the bucket and its contents.
Policies can grant or deny access to specific AWS accounts, IAM users, roles, or federated users.
Bucket policies can also specify conditions for access, such as IP address ranges or request headers.
Access Control Lists (ACLs):

ACLs are legacy access control mechanisms that allow you to grant permissions to individual objects within the bucket.
ACLs can grant permissions to specific AWS accounts or predefined groups (e.g., "authenticated users," "log delivery group").
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS):

CORS rules allow you to control access to your S3 resources from web browsers using XMLHttpRequests (XHR).
=====================================================
71.different between pubic ip address and private ip address in aws?
In AWS, both public and private IP addresses are used to identify resources within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC),

Public IP Address:

A public IP address is reachable from the public internet. It allows resources, such as EC2 instances, to communicate directly with the internet.
Private IP Address:

A private IP address is used for communication within the VPC and is not reachable directly from the internet. It is used for internal networking purposes.
==================================================
72.what is elastic IP address in AWS?
Elastic IP addresses offer a convenient way to maintain a static public IP address for your EC2 instances in AWS, providing flexibility and reliability for your cloud-based applications and services.
====================================================
73.how can we encrypt the data in ec2 instance?

Encrypting Data at Rest:

Think of your data when it's just sitting on your EC2 instance's hard drive. We want to protect it there.
One way to do this is by using a special kind of hard drive called EBS volume, and we can turn on a setting to make sure anything stored on that hard drive is scrambled up in a way that only we can unscramble it. This is like putting a lock on your data so that even if someone gets access to your hard drive, they can't read it without the key.
Another way is if your applications, like databases or file systems, have their own way of locking up their data. This is like those applications having their own locks on their data drawers.
Encrypting Data in Transit:

Now, think about when your data is traveling between your EC2 instance and other places, like your computer or a different server.
Just like you might put your data in a locked box when sending it through the mail to keep it safe, we use something called TLS/SSL encryption for data traveling over the internet. It's like putting your data in a secure, locked box before sending it, so even if someone tries to peek at it while it's on its way, they can't see what's inside.
When you're connecting to your EC2 instance remotely, like using SSH to talk to it from your computer, SSH makes sure that the conversation is secure, so nobody can eavesdrop on what you're saying or doing.
Managing Encryption Keys:

Imagine your encryption key as the special key that unlocks your locked data. You want to make sure that key is kept safe.
AWS Key Management Service (KMS) is like a really secure keychain where you can store your keys. You can make different keys for different locks, like one for your data on EBS volumes and another for your application's secrets.
It's important to take care of these keys, just like you would with your house keys. Keep them safe and don't let just anyone get hold of them.
